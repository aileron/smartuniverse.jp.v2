  vision:
    title: “Evolution of 1000 Years”
    body: With our exception, the systems of the past made means into ends and gave birth to ruinous and unproductive conflicts and new issues. To present the ruin of systems, it is necessary to constantly evolve to match both people’s values, which change with time, and society in the aggregate. Our vision is to preserve a Smart Universe for all mankind by capturing the changes in the world in real time with the power of technology and continuing evolution for the next 1000 years.

  career:
    title: Omniscient
    body: The past 2000 years have seen the continuous invention of various political and economic systems such as bartering, city-states, monetary economies, nation-states, and stock exchanges. Judging by the explosive evolutionary speed of technology, however, the next 30 years may see changes equaling that of the past 2000 years. We believe that there will be the invention of a new system that places each of us at the center of the world, and most of humanity’s problems that seemed intractable up to this point will be solved.
